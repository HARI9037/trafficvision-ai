Traffic Monitoring and Speed Estimation System is a real-time computer vision application that uses YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and ByteTrack for multi-object tracking. It assigns unique IDs, estimates vehicle speed in km/h, generates annotated output video, and exports detailed tracking data to CSV for traffic analysis and reporting.
